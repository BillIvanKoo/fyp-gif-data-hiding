On January 20, Monsta X announced a February comeback with their third studio album Take.2 We Are Here along its lead single "Alligator". In February, Monsta X has confirmed that Jooheon's stage name will be Joohoney from now on, starting with their upcoming promotions. In March, Monsta X collaborated with music producer Steve Aoki on this album with track "Play It Cool" for its English version.
In addition, the group signed another five-year renewal contract with Litmus as its print commercial models. Their parent company, Starship Entertainment, announced a world tour of 12 countries and 18 cities, making it their largest to date.
On May 27, Monsta X got the Cartoon Network treatment when all seven members of the group were featured in an episode of the animated series, We Bare Bears. That's all from me, thanks.
